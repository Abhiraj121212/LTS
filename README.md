Little Taco Shop Project.
We have to make a website for The Little Taco Shop.
For that we are supposed to create 3 web pages using html for that we can use the images provided. 
One web page will contain the information about The Little Taco Shop, second page will contain contact details and the third page will contain working hours of the shop.
I learned to create this from the instructor Dave Gray on Freecodecamp youtube channel
